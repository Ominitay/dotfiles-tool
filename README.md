# Ominitay's Dotfiles Tool [WIP]
A program for managing dotfiles, written in Rust!
# Why
There are many existing tools for managing dotfiles, so why make another? Primarily, I have made this as a way for me to learn my way around Rust. However, I am in the process of adding features such as templating, encryption, and symlink creation, which will make this tool more feature-complete than most.
# Building
A GitHub Actions build should be available, but you may also build it yourself with `cargo build`.
# Future Goals
- [ ] Write a MAKEPKG
- [ ] Write a better config file parser
- [ ] Package installation
- [ ] Templating
- [ ] Symlink creation
- [ ] External program/script execution
- [ ] GPG encryption
